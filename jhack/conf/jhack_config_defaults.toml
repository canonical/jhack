# Only exception is nuke: to disable that one too, edit [nuke]ask_for_confirmation above.
# This mode is intended for development environments and should be disabled in production!
# This is *for your own good*.
# If you want to enable destructive mode on a per-command basis, you can
# set the envvar `JHACK_PROFILE=devmode` before running jhack.
