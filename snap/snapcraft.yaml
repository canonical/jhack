version: '0.3.7'
summary: Cli tool packed with juju hacks.

description: |
  An opinionated collection of scripts and utilities to make
  charming charming again. Many of the scripts in jhack interact with the juju snap and
  communicate with its client by issuing `juju` cli calls.
  This snap requires write access to ~/.local/share/juju via an interface named
  dot-local-share-juju, so that the juju client configuration can be used to talk to the
  user's clouds, controllers and models.
